How is it that I just don't want to do stuff when I don't have a clear goal, even though I can do stuff that's more fun. Well the answer is simple, it's a question about what has meaning. Most people trigger far more on social rewards then anything else so they do what people they care for will praise the most. One shall not forgive that which is the most important and fun to one self. There shall later be a list of exceptions but not before I take care of my own bad habbit of doing nothing. The guess that isn't taken out shall be of naught and will later be purged frog existance. I will need to take the name and generate the menu and learn of the built in functions that already are written. There can of course be of value in the writing in the functions in them selves. I shall check and see if I can do the same with strings, it shall be of great joy to me. I can of course not forgett to leave the papers to the teacher in question or great pain shall fall upon my self. Let the counting commence. And use map.
